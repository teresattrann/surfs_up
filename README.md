## Summary: 
We can see the average temperature for June is around 74.94 degrees and the average temperature for December is 71.04 degrees. Two additonal queries we can perform to gather more weather data for June and December is precipitation and humidity. Depending on the precipitation, we see whether or not people are more likely to come to the surf and ice cream shop or not. As with humidity, if there is a higher humidity it would feel warmer, and a lower humidity, it would feel cooler, which can also play a factor on the amount of people who would buy ice cream or go surfing.
